This section provides guidance on installation of  utilizing the full installation media with KVM and ``virt-manager``.
This section assumes you have previously setup an account with SCC and downloaded the SLES 12 full installation media.

. Configure your machine with at least 4096 MB RAM and a minimum of 2 CPUs. 
. Create a storage device with a minimum of 230 GB storage space for the installation. During the partitioning setup of the SLES 12 installation this disk should be partitioned into a 4 GB `swap` a 130 GB partition (or a dedicated virtual disk) for [path]_/var/spacewalk/_ (XFS) and an additional 50 GB partition (or a dedicated virtual disk) for [path]_/var/lib/pgsql/_ (XFS).
