Congratulations! You should now be presented with the  Front Page. <<_quickstart.first.channel.sync>>
 will help prepare the server for connecting your first client.

== Synchronizing with  (SCC)


(SCC) maintains a collection of repositories which contain packages, software and updates for all supported client systems.
These repositories are organized into channels each of which provide software specific to a distribution, release and architecture.
You must synchronize your  Server with SCC to add channels for your client systems.
After synchronizing with SCC your clients are able to receive updates or be organized into groups to be assigned to a specific software channel.
This section covers synchronizing with SCC from the  and adding your first client channels. 

.Procedure: Synchronizing with ... From the   start page select menu:Admin[Setup Wizard] . 
... From the menu:Setup Wizard[] page select the menu: Products[] tab. Wait a moment for the menu:Available Products Below[] list to populate. You are present with a list of repositories provided from SCC. Each of these repositories represents a single software source known as a [path]_Base Channel_ within . You can also see the architecture, channels, and status information from this page. 
+


image::admin_suse_products.png[]
... As you are adding a  12 SP2 client based on the [path]_x86_64_ architecture, scroll down the page and select the check box for this channel now. 
**** Add single channels to  by selecting the check box to the left the menu:+[] button of each channel. 
**** Add multiple channels by selecting the check boxes to the left of the channels list and then schedule synchronization by clicking the `\+ Add products` button located at the bottom of the page. 


After adding your first channel  will schedule the channel to be copied and begin mirroring it.
This can take a long time as  must copy all software sources from the Vendor repositories located at  to your servers local [replaceable]``/var/spacewalk/`` directory. 

.PostgreSQL and Transparant Huge Pages
[TIP]
====
In some environments, Transparent Huge Pages provided by the kernel may slow down PostgreSQL workloads significantly. 

To disable transparant huge pages set the `transparent_hugepage` kernel parameter to ``never``.
This has to be changed in [path]_/etc/default/grub_
 and added to the line ``GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT``, for example: 

----
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="resume=/dev/sda1 splash=silent quiet showopts elevator=noop transparent_hugepage=never"
----

To write the new configuration run ``grub2-mkconfig -o
     /boot/grub2/grub.cfg``.
To update the grub2 during boot run ``grub2-install
     /dev/sda``. 
====


Monitor channel synchronization process in real-time by viewing channel log files located in the following directory: 

----
example-server:/var/log/rhn/reposync/# tail -f Channel_Name.log
----


After your channel sync has completed proceed to <<_preparing.and.registering.clients>>
.
