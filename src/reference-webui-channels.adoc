== Channels
(((channel list )))

(((WebLogic,channel list)))


The menu:Channels[]
 page is the first to appear in the menu:Software[]
 category.
A software channel provides packages grouped by products or applications to simplify the selection of packages to be installed on a system. 

There are two types of software channels: base channels and child channels. 

Base Channels::
A base channel consists of packages built for a specific architecture and release.
For example, all of the packages in 12 for the `x86_64` architecture make up a base channel.
The list of packages in 12 for the `s390x` architecture make up a different base channel. 
+
A system must be subscribed to only one base channel assigned automatically during registration based on the  release and system architecture.
For paid base channels, an associated subscription must exist. 
+
##toms 2011-02-07: Need to add a section about Long Term Support?#
Child Channels::
A child channel is associated with a base channel and provides extra packages.
For example, an organization can create a child channel associated with  on `x86_64` architecture that contains extra packages for a custom application. 
+
Especially important are the  Tools channels that are available for every base channel.
These tools channels provide the tools needed to connect the clients with the  server. 
+
A system can be subscribed to multiple child channels of its base channel.
Only packages provided by a subscribed channel can be installed or updated.
Administrators and Channel Administrators have channel management authority.
This authority gives them the ability to create and manage their own custom channels. 
+


[NOTE]
====
Do not create child channels containing packages that are not compatible with the client system.

Channels can be further distinguished by relevance: menu:All[]
