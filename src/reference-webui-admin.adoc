After saving, a new credential card will be displayed.
Buttons below the credential card allow you to: 

* see the credential validation status (green tick or red cross icon). To re-check the credential with SCC, click the icon; 
* set the primary credentials for inter-server synchronization (yellow star icon); 
* list the subscriptions related to a certain credential (list icon);

The products displayed are directly linked to your organization credentials and your  subscriptions.
Product extentions and modules are shown when you select the corresponding base product or click the plus sign to its left.
After you have made your selection, click menu:Add products[]

.If Synchronization Fails
[IMPORTANT]
====
SUSE does not automatically trust 3rd party GPG keys.
Should a reposync fail you can detect if an untrusted GPG key is the root cause by viewing log files located in: 

----
/var/log/rhn/reposync
----

Look for lines similar to the following: 

----
['/usr/bin/spacewalk-repo-sync', '--channel', 'sle-12-sp1-ga-desktop-
      nvidia-driver-x86_64', '--type', 'yum', '--non-interactive']
    ChannelException: The GPG key for this repository is not part of
      the keyring.
    Please run spacewalk-repo-sync in interactive mode to import it.
----
====
+
Alternatively, you can add listed channels right away by clicking the menu:Add this product[]
button in the status column.
A progress bar will be displayed.
The main product will expand, and now you can select add-on products belonging to the product that is currently added.
To check for required channels, click the list icon in the menu:Channels[]
column.
When a product is downloaded and ready to use, the state will change to menu:Finished[]

[[_s2_sattools_org_details_conf]]
=== menu:Organization Details[]menu:Configuration[]


Here you enable the Organization Administrator to manage Organization configuration, configure the organization to use staged contents ("`pre-fetching`"pre-fetching
 packages, etc.), set up software crash reporting, and upload of SCAP files. 


image::admin_organization_configuration.png[]



SUSE Manager Configuration::
Enable menu:Allow Organization Admin to manage Organization
Configuration[]
if wanted. 

Organization Configuration::

* menu:Crash File Upload Size Limit[]
* menu:Enable Upload Of Detailed SCAP Files[]
* menu:SCAP File Upload Size Limit[]
* menu:Allow Deletion of SCAP Results[]
* menu:Allow Deletion After (period in days)[]

When settings are done, confirm with clicking the menu:Update
    Organization[]
 button. 

.Enable Staging Contents
The clients will download packages in advance and stage them.
This has the advantage that the package installation action will take place immediately, when the schedule is actually executed.
This "`pre-fetching`"pre-fetching
 saves maintenance window time, which is good for service uptime. 


For staging contents ("`pre-fetching`"pre-fetching
), edit on the client [path]_/etc/sysconfig/rhn/up2date_
: 

----
stagingContent=1
stagingContentWindow=24
----

`stagingContentWindow` is a time value expressed in hours and determines when downloading will start.
It is the number of hours before the scheduled installation or update time.
In this case, it means `24` hours before the installation time.
The exact download start time depends on the contact methodwhen the next `rhn_check` is performed. 

Next time an action is scheduled, packages will automatically be downloaded but not installed yet.
When the scheduled time comes, the action will use the staged version. 

.Minion Content Staging
Every Organization administrator can enable Content Staging from the Organization configuration page menu:Admin[Organization > OrgName > Configuration > Enable Staging
     Contents]
.
Prior to SUSE Manager 3.1, this option was read-only by traditional clients for staging content (packages and patches) before an installation, to help reduce the time required for installing and updating packages and patches.
Beginning with SUSE Manager 3.1, Enable Staging Contents also targets Salt minions for the selected Organization. 


Staging content for minions is affected by two parameters. 

* [path]_salt_content_staging_advance:_ expresses the advance time, in hours, for the content staging window to open with regard to the scheduled installation/upgrade time. 
* [path]_salt_content_staging_window:_ expresses the duration, in hours, of the time window for Salt minions to stage packages in advance of scheduled installations or upgrades. 


A value of *salt_content_staging_advance* equal to *salt_content_staging_window* results in the content staging window closing exactly when the installation/upgrade is scheduled to be executed, a larger value allows  separating the download time from the installation time. 

These options are configured in [path]_/usr/share/rhn/config-defaults/rhn_java.conf_
 and by default assume the following values: 

* [path]_salt_content_staging_advance: 8 hours_
* [path]_salt_content_staging_window: 8 hours_


[NOTE]
====
These parameters will only have an effect when Content Staging is enabled for the targeted Organization.

The HTTP proxy should be of the form: ``hostname:port``; the default port `8080` will be used if none is explicitly provided.
HTTP proxy settings for client systems to connect to this  can be different, and will be configured separately, for example via <<_s3_sattools_config_bootstrap>>

Enable Client GPG checking::
GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) 

Enable Remote Configuration::
Enable remote configuration management and remote command acceptance of the systems to be bootstrapped to the . Both features are useful for completing client configuration.

=== menu:Admin[]menu:Manager Configuration[]menu:Bare-metal systems[]


Here you can add unprovisioned ("bare-metal") systems capable of booting using PXE to an organization.

First click menu:Enable adding to this

.
Those systems then will appear in the menu:Systems[]
 list, where regular provisioning via autoinstallation is possible in a completely unattended fashion.
Only AMD64/Intel 64 systems with at least 1 GB of RAM are supported.
server will use its integrated Cobbler instance and will act as TFTP server for this feature to work, so the network segment that connects it to target systems must be properly configured.
In particular, a DHCP server must exist and have a next-server configuration parameter set to the  server IP address or hostname. 

When enabled, any bare-metal system connected to the SUSE Manager server network will be automatically added to the organization when it powers on.
The process typically takes a few minutes; when it finishes, the system will automatically shut down and then appear in the menu:Systems[]
 list. 

[NOTE]
====
New systems will be added to the organization of the administrator who enabled this feature.
To change the organization, disable the feature, log in as an administrator of a different organization and enable it again. 
====


Provisioning can be initiated by clicking the menu:Provisioning[]
 tab.
In case of bare-metal systems, though, provisioning cannot be scheduled, it will happen automatically when it is completely configured and the system is powered on. 

It is possible to use menu:System Set Manager[]
 with bare-metal systems, although in that case some features will not be available as those systems do not have an operating system installed.
This limitation also applies to mixed sets with regular and bare-metal systems: full features will be enabled again when all bare-metal systems are removed from the set.

=== Mapping  Master Server Organizations to Slave Organizations


A mapping between organizational names on the master  allows for channel access permissions being set on the master server and propagated when content is synchronized to a slave . Not all organization and channel details need to be mapped for all slaves.
administrators can select which permissions and organizations can be synchronized by allowing or omitting mappings. 

To complete the mapping, log in to the Slave  as administrator.
Click menu:Admin[ISS
    Configuration > Slave Setup]
 and select a master  by clicking its name.
Use the drop-down box to map the exported master organization name to a matching local organization in the slave , then click menu:Update Mapping[]
