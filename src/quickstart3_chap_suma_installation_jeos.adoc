== Virtual Machine Manager (virt-manager) Settings

.Version Information
[NOTE]
====
 3.1 was originally released as a SLES 12 SP2 extension.
With the next maintenance update (2017),  3.1 will be based on SLES 12 SP3 and it will support SLE 12 SP3 clients officially.
In the following sections and chapters, it is highly recommended to use SLE 12 SP3 instead of SP2. 
====


This chapter provides the required (KVM) settings for installation of  Just Enough Operating System (JeOS) 12 as the base for  3.1.
A kernel virtual machine (KVM) combined with Virtual Machine Manager (``virt-manager``) will be used as a sandbox for your first installation.

== JeOS KVM Settings


Create 3 additional virtual disks required for the  storage partitions. 

.Procedure: Creating the Required Partitions with KVM
. Create a new virtual machine using the downloaded JeOS KVM image and select menu:Import existing disk image[] . 
. Configure RAM and number of CPU's: At least 4 GB RAM and 2 CPUs. 
. Name your KVM machine and select the menu:Customize configuration before install[] check box. 
. Select the menu:Add Hardware[] button and create three new virtual disks with the following specifications. These disks will be partitioned and mounted in <<_proc.jeos.susemgr.prep>> .

SUSEConnect -p SUSE-Manager-Server/3.1/x86_64 -r SUSE_MANAGER_CODE
----
.. Install [package]#yast2-storage# with all required dependencies (approx. 40 packages, 30 MB when installed).  This basic administration package is required for preparing storage partitions:

.. SLES 12 by default uses the BTRFS file system. A mount point is created automatically for [path]_/var/lib/pgsql/_ (even when not installed). This must be removed or commented out from the [path]_/etc/fstab_ entries. As  edit [path]_/etc/fstab_ and comment out or remove the line: 
+
+

----
/var/lib/pgsql btrfs subvol=@/var/lib/pgsql 0 0
----
+

.Removing the `pgsql` in the[path]_/etc/fstab_Entry
[WARNING]
====
If you do not remove this line from fstab the first time you shutdown the server you will lose your database.
This occurs because you will have duplicate entries in the fstab. 
====
.. Exit the partitioner and install the  pattern:
